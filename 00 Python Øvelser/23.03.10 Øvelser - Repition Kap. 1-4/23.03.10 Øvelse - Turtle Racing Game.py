# Try to make a racing game using the turtle module in Python.
# Imagine a number of turtles lined up beside each other.
# At the other end of the screen is the goal line.
# You may now bet on a turtle (take an input from the user)
# Next, in a loop, each turtle moves a random number of pixels
# The first turtle that reaches the line is the winner.
# Check if the player (user) won or lost.
# Add-ons could be:
# Sound and graphics.

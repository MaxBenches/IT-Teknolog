# Make a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100
# Ask the player to guess the number
# Tell the player if the number is higher or lower
# Continue until the user guesses the right number
# Print out the total number of guesses, this is the score and must be as low as possible.
# You must use functions, ex. getRandomNumber(), checkNumber()
# Create a flow chart of your program (one flow for each function)
# Creat IPO charts for each function.
